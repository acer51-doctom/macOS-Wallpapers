# macOS-Wallpapers
So uh. This is just a repo of macOS wallpapers. Yeah. They are from High Sierra 10.13  and later. And since this is a fork, I'll add my owns!!! :+1:

Btw, if you're wondering what's in the Releases, it's just a .zip of the wallpapers.

> [!NOTE]
> I do NOT own these wallpapers. They are created with :heart: (love) and :cry: (tears) from Apple Inc. (and also this fork is from @foxt)
